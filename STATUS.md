# Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-10-06

## Current Phase

**Phase 6 — Validation MVP Build**

## Current Work

**Issue #4 — Product Discovery Pages: in progress (PR4.2 deployed; acceptance review)**

Issue #3 is closed (acceptance commit 0e40405). PR4.1 is deployed as b7568d1. PR4.2 is pushed and deployed as c9dad66. On 2026-10-06 the operator confirmed rehearsal/apply success, all seven PR4.2 production SQL checks, the public Obsidian page without a preview banner, and unavailable Logseq/missing-product pages. The operator also confirmed 5 publication/model tests, lint, typecheck, build and diff checks. Only Obsidian is published; 29 other products and all three routes remain draft. See PRODUCT_PAGES_ACCEPTANCE.md for evidence and remaining acceptance checks.

## Next Work

Complete the remaining production acceptance checks for the shared product-page template: inspect the full page, outbound CTA/source links, mobile layout and public metadata. Do not require publication of all 29 drafts merely to close the page implementation issue; each future product retains its separate review requirement. Keep #4 open until its acceptance is confirmed. Escape Route navigation belongs to #5, homepage discovery navigation to #6, and analytics to #8.

## Completed Issues

## Open Roadmap

- [x] #1 Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- [x] #2 Discovery Graph Data Model
- [x] #3 Seed Data & Evidence Pipeline — draft dataset accepted; GitHub closed
- [ ] #4 Product Discovery Pages
- [ ] #5 Escape Route Engine
- [ ] #6 Homepage & Discovery Navigation
- [ ] #7 Natural-Language Discovery
- [ ] #8 Discovery Analytics
- [ ] #9 SEO & GEO Infrastructure
- [ ] #10 Evidence & Quality Audit
- [ ] #11 Production Validation Launch

## Foundation State

- **Application:** Next.js 16.3.8 / React 19.3.0 / TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js 24
- **Database:** shared Supabase project with isolated `software_discovery` schema
- **Supabase clients:** browser and server clients scoped to `software_discovery`
- **CI:** GitHub Actions runs install, lint, typecheck, and production build
- **Deployment:** Vercel production deployment passing
- **Production health:** configuration valid; initial graph imports and counts verified by the operator
- **Environment:** Supabase public URL and publishable key configured in Vercel Production and Preview
- **Security audit:** five high-severity findings currently originate from the ESLint development-tooling transitive dependency chain (`eslint-config-next` → `@next/eslint-plugin-next` → `fast-glob` → `micromatch`). No forced breaking remediation was applied; revisit when a non-breaking upstream remediation is available.

## Product Thesis

## Initial Scope

- 5 anchor ecosystems
- 30–40 verified products
- evidence-backed core attributes
- 10 launch Escape Routes
- natural-language discovery
- discovery analytics
- SEO/GEO foundation
- 30-day production validation

## Validation Status

**Not started**

**Validation Start Date:** N/A

Issue #11 marks Day 0 of the validation window. Foundation deployment does not start validation.

## Growth Diagnostic Status

**Deferred / Gate not reached**

Growth Diagnostic Engine is not part of the Validation MVP.

Evaluation gate:

> At least 10 products must have sufficient product-level impressions and comparative CTR/intent data to support meaningful creator insights.

## Current Blockers

None.

## Resume Instructions

When resuming development:

1. Read `STATUS.md`.
2. Read `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`.
3. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4. Read `ARCHITECTURE_GUARDRAILS.md`.
5. Confirm the active GitHub Issue.
6. Inspect current code before changing architecture.
7. Keep implementation scoped to the active Issue.
8. Update this file when an Issue closes or validation state changes.
