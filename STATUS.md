## Current Phase

**Phase 6 — Validation MVP Build**

## Current Work

**Issue #3 — Seed Data & Evidence Pipeline: in progress**

PR3.2C is deployed. The initial six Notion products, 83 evidence fragments, and three draft routes are imported in production; all 17 counts were verified by the operator. PR3.3 prepares 30 draft products across five ecosystems. Human review and the expansion production import remain pending.

## Next Work

Review the expansion records, import the five ecosystem batches, and verify the resulting graph. Resolve remaining dataset gaps before closing #3 or publishing products.

## Completed Issues

- [ ] #6 Homepage & Discovery Navigation
- [ ] #7 Natural-Language Discovery
- [ ] #8 Discovery Analytics
- [ ] #9 SEO & GEO Infrastructure
- [ ] #10 Evidence & Quality Audit
- [ ] #11 Production Validation Launch

## Foundation State

- **Application:** Next.js 16.3.8 / React 19.3.0 / TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js 24
- **Database:** shared Supabase project with isolated `software_discovery` schema
- **Supabase clients:** browser and server clients scoped to `software_discovery`
- **CI:** GitHub Actions runs install, lint, typecheck, and production build
- **Deployment:** Vercel production deployment passing
- **Production health:** configuration valid; initial graph imports and counts verified by the operator
- **Environment:** Supabase public URL and publishable key configured in Vercel Production and Preview
- **Security audit:** five high-severity findings currently originate from the ESLint development-tooling transitive dependency chain (`eslint-config-next` → `@next/eslint-plugin-next` → `fast-glob` → `micromatch`). No forced breaking remediation was applied; revisit when a non-breaking upstream remediation is available.

## Initial Scope

- 5 anchor ecosystems
- 30–40 verified products
- evidence-backed core attributes
- 10 launch Escape Routes
- natural-language discovery
- discovery analytics
- SEO/GEO foundation
- 30-day production validation

## Validation Status

**Not started**

**Validation Start Date:** N/A

Issue #11 marks Day 0 of the validation window. Foundation deployment does not start validation.

## Growth Diagnostic Status

**Deferred / Gate not reached**

Growth Diagnostic Engine is not part of the Validation MVP.

Evaluation gate:

> At least 10 products must have sufficient product-level impressions and comparative CTR/intent data to support meaningful creator insights.

## Current Blockers

None.

## Resume Instructions

When resuming development:

1. Read `STATUS.md`.
2. Read `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`.
3. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4. Read `ARCHITECTURE_GUARDRAILS.md`.
5. Confirm the active GitHub Issue.
6. Inspect current code before changing architecture.
7. Keep implementation scoped to the active Issue.
8. Update this file when an Issue closes or validation state changes.
