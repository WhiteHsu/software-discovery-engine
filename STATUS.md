# Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-10-07

## Current Phase

**Phase 6 — Validation MVP Build**

## Current Work

**Issue #5 — Escape Route Engine: in progress (PR5.1 engine and local preview)**

Issue #4 was closed by the owner on 2026-10-07 after production acceptance. Application/publication commits b7568d1 and c9dad66; acceptance commits 80a8828 and 80e537e. The owner confirmed official CTA and pricing-source clicks in Chrome. Only Obsidian is published; other products and all routes retain their existing draft status.

PR5.1 implements ten validation intent definitions, structured evidence qualification, bounded novelty ranking, route comparison pages and canonical product navigation. Local previews expose explicit qualification blockers. No database writes or publication are included. See ESCAPE_ROUTES.md and the generated readiness report.

## Next Work

Review and complete route-specific taxonomy, candidate membership and evidence. Offline Notion and no-AI Notion each currently have only two qualified draft candidates; no route meets the three-published-candidate launch threshold. Then prepare separately reviewed route/product publication packets and validate production route behavior. #5 remains open; ten configured preview intents do not equal ten launch-ready published routes.

## Completed Issues

- [x] #4 Product Discovery Pages — owner closed; production accepted

- [x] #1 Foundation & Core Infrastructure

- [x] #2 Discovery Graph Data Model
- [x] #3 Seed Data & Evidence Pipeline — draft dataset accepted; GitHub closed

## Open Roadmap

- [ ] #5 Escape Route Engine
- [ ] #6 Homepage & Discovery Navigation
- [ ] #7 Natural-Language Discovery
- [ ] #8 Discovery Analytics
- [ ] #9 SEO & GEO Infrastructure
- [ ] #10 Evidence & Quality Audit
- [ ] #11 Production Validation Launch

## Foundation State

- **Application:** Next.js 16.3.8 / React 19.3.0 / TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js 24
- **Database:** shared Supabase project with isolated `software_discovery` schema
- **Supabase clients:** browser and server clients scoped to `software_discovery`
- **CI:** GitHub Actions runs install, lint, typecheck, and production build
- **Deployment:** Vercel production deployment passing
- **Production health:** configuration valid; initial graph imports and counts verified by the operator
- **Environment:** Supabase public URL and publishable key configured in Vercel Production and Preview
- **Security audit:** five high-severity findings currently originate from the ESLint development-tooling transitive dependency chain (`eslint-config-next` → `@next/eslint-plugin-next` → `fast-glob` → `micromatch`). No forced breaking remediation was applied; revisit when a non-breaking upstream remediation is available.

## Product Thesis

## Initial Scope

- 5 anchor ecosystems
- 30–40 verified products
- evidence-backed core attributes
- 10 launch Escape Routes
- natural-language discovery
- discovery analytics
- SEO/GEO foundation
- 30-day production validation

## Validation Status

**Not started**

**Validation Start Date:** N/A

Issue #11 marks Day 0 of the validation window. Foundation deployment does not start validation.

## Growth Diagnostic Status

**Deferred / Gate not reached**

Growth Diagnostic Engine is not part of the Validation MVP.

Evaluation gate:

> At least 10 products must have sufficient product-level impressions and comparative CTR/intent data to support meaningful creator insights.

## Current Blockers

None.

## Resume Instructions

When resuming development:

1. Read `STATUS.md`.
2. Read `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`.
3. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4. Read `ARCHITECTURE_GUARDRAILS.md`.
5. Confirm the active GitHub Issue.
6. Inspect current code before changing architecture.
7. Keep implementation scoped to the active Issue.
8. Update this file when an Issue closes or validation state changes.
